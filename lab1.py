# Add another property to the Car class called "odometer".
# This property should be initialised to 0.




# Create two Car objects. One should be a red Toyota and the other a blue Ford.
car1 =  



# Start the engine of the red Toyota.



# Create a method called "drive" that takes a distance as a parameter.
# The car can only be driven if the engine is on.



# Attempt to drive both cars 100Km.



# Print the brand, odometer and colour of both cars.
